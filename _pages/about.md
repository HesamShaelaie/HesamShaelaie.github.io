I am a Ph.D. student in the department of [Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/ise) at [Lehigh University](https://www.lehigh.edu/) and working with Prof. [Ted Ralphs](https://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/~ted/) and Prof. [Larry Snyder](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/faculty/lawrence-v-snyder). I earned my B.Sc. (2013) and M.Sc. (2016) in [Industrial Engineering](https://inde.um.ac.ir/index.php?lang=en) at [Ferdowsi University of Mashhad](https://en.um.ac.ir/), Mashhad, Iran.

My current research interests include discrete, bi-level optimization, and analysis of algorithms for machine learning. To be more specific, I am interested in using machine learning techniques in discrete optimization.
